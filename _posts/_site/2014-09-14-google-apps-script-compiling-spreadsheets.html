<p>At my work with the Free Library / City of Philadelphia Office of Innovation and Technology, I use Google Spreadsheets to track visitors to public computer labs. I was recently asked to come up a way of compiling 19 different spreadsheets into one master spreadsheet. I wrote a Google Apps script that copies a the current sheet’s values to a master spreadsheet (note: this doesn’t copy the the entire spreadsheet, just the currently-viewd sheet). In the master spreadsheet, the values go into one sheet where an extra column is added pulling in the names of the source spreadsheet and sheet (For my purposes these corresponded to the name of a computer lab and month of usage data). Additionally, a separate sheet in the master logs all copy operations with a timestamp.</p>
